            Hi i'm

            I am passionate about video games ever since I was introduced to them at a very young age, and it serves as a way of entertainment. The first platform that I played games on was a desktop computer, then the Playstation 4 console, and now a desktop computer. 
            
            Video games have made a great impact on my life as they gave me an interest in other things, and it helped also helped me with my problems. One example of this is playing the Sims games gave me an interest in designing houses or rooms. From that, I was going to choose Architecture as my course, but then I found out about the course Entertainment and Multimedia Computing or EMC. 
            
            The main reason why I chose EMC over Architecture is how it creates fun and memorable moments with your friends or family by playing games. Besides that, video games helped me with my depression since they made me feel happy and not think about my problems. This is why it gives me an appreciation towards games, and I hope that in the future, I would create a game that would make an impact on others as to how video games made an impact on me.
